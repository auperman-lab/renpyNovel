    c "  \"speaking internally\" I've never been one for academics. While others spent their adolescence buried in books, I was out there, living life. But now, surrounded by these responsible and ambitious students, I can't help but feel out of place"

    "As Mrs. [coj] enters the room, the atmosphere shifts slightly"

    coj "Good morning, everyone. I trust you're all settling in well. Now, as you know, every group needs a leader to guide them through the semester. Let's hear from our candidates."

    " [a] and the girl step forward, each vying for the position with their own unique approach."

    c "  \"gesticulating wildly\" Listen up, everyone! I've got big plans for this group. With me at the helm, we'll conquer every challenge that comes our way"

    "You try to focus on what Andrei is saying, but your mind drifts, feeling disconnected from the fervor in the room."

    c "  \"speaking internally\"  I should be paying attention, but it's hard to concentrate. Andrei's enthusiasm is infectious, but it feels forced, like he's trying too hard to impress. Is that what it takes to lead in this environment?"

    "As [girl] presents her case, she speaks softly but with sincerity, her words falling on deaf ears amidst the chaos of the room."

    girl "Um, hi everyone. I'm [girl], and I may not be the loudest voice in the room, but I believe in leading by example. Together, we can achieve great things if we work as a team."

    "Despite her genuine demeanor, the crowd seems unmoved, their attention still drawn to Andrei's charismatic display."

    c "  \"speaking internally\" She seems nice, genuine even. But in a room full of noise, it's easy to overlook the quieter voices. Is that how it's always been?"

    "As the votes are cast and tallied, it becomes clear that Andrei has won the majority, his boisterous personality overshadowing the girl's quieter strength."

    coj "Well, it seems we have our leader. Congratulations, Andrei. Now, let's exlore the Campus"

    "You watch silently as [a] assumes his new role, a sense of resignation settling over you as you realizes that in this environment, loudness often triumphs over substance."

    c "  \"speaking internally\" I guess this is how it goes. In a world where volume speaks louder than words, I wonder where I fit in."

    "After rummaging through the pantry, you settle on making pelmeni, the most complicated food you can make."

    c "Pelmeni it is, then. Can't go wrong with that."

    "As you wait for the pelmeni to cook, your mind wanders, thoughts of freedom and financial stability weighing heavily on your mind."

    c "  \"speaking internally\" Freedom... It's like air, something you only truly appreciate when it's taken away. And right now, I feel suffocated, trapped in a cycle of uncertainty. If only I could grasp it, hold it in my hands like a lifeline."

    c "But freedom doesn't come easy, does it? It demands sacrifice, demands that I choose one path and stick to it."
    c "Maybe I've been spreading myself too thin, trying to be everything to everyone. Perhaps it's time to focus, to hone in on one aspect of myself and see where it leads."
    c " But which part of me should I choose? Which piece of the puzzle holds the key to my liberation? If only I knew..."

    "You recall your previous job at the Massage Room, a place where you could earn some extra cash to support yourself and your family."

    "You pick up your phone and dial the Manager's number, your heart pounding with anticipation."

    manager "\"gruffly\" Covalenco, what do you want? I'm busy."

    c "I was just wondering if there are any job opportunities available. I could really use the extra income."

    manager "\"sighs\" Extra income, huh? What makes you think I'd hire you again after what you pulled last time?"

    c "\"shifts uncomfortably\" I know I made a mistake, but I've learned from it. I'm a student now, just trying to make ends meet."

    manager "\"eyes narrow\" And why should I trust you won't cause more trouble? I run a tight ship here, and I can't afford any more scandals."

    c "\"desperation creeping into his voice\" I understand, Manager. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I'll work for whatever wage you offer, even if it's just a fraction of what I used to earn. Please, I need this job."
