    alcas " \"hesitant\" Well, it's not a story I share often, but I suppose you deserve to know. Back in the 90s, things were different. I had dreams, Covalenco. Big dreams."
    c "What kind of dreams?"
    alcas " \"wistful\"  I wanted to be a doctor. I was top of my class, you know? Always had my sights set on making a difference in people's lives."

    alcas "At first, I played by their rules, begged where they told me to beg. Didn't understand the business , you know? City's like a jungle, and every street has its king. Begging was like an industry, and I was just another worker."
    c "But things changed?"
    alcas  "\"nods\"Yeah, things changed. I got older, stopped giving a damn about their system. Started begging wherever I damn well pleased. But you know what happens when you step out of line? Every night, like clockwork, there were men waiting to remind me who owned the streets."
    c  "\"reflecting silently\"It's incredible how quickly life can take a turn. One moment, you're on top of the world, dreaming of becoming a doctor. The next, you're scraping by, just trying to survive. It makes me grateful for what I have, for the opportunities I've been given. My parents survived the chaos of the '90s, and here I am, living in a time of relative peace and stability. It's easy to take it all for granted, but stories like Alcas's remind me just how fortunate I am."
    alcas "So now tell me too about yourself, every time you help me , i dont like it."
    c  "\"hesitant\"Well, [alcas], it's... it's complicated. You know, university stuff. I have exams coming up, and there's this one professor, [coj]. She's tough, really tough. I'm worried she won't let me pass."
